# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 12.x]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          # Set always-auth in
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: NPM Install
        run: npm install

      - name: NPM build
        run: npm run build
