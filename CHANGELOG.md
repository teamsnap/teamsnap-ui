## [2.13.2] - 2018-07-30

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/97

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/98

## [2.11.0] - 2018-06-12

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/94

## [2.10.0] - 2018-06-06

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/93

### Fixed

## [2.9.0] - 2018-05-31

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/88

### Changed

- Change font paths in CSS `@font-face` declarations from relative to absolute. These now reference a fixed location of the fonts on the dugout CDN (http://dugout.teamsnap.com/teamsnap-ui/2.5.1/assets/fonts/...), which makes TeamSnap UI self-contained and more flexible for use in a variety of projects. A version number of TeamSnap UI was somewhat randomly picked because the fonts are versioned along with everything else, but they won't actually change unless we change our font stack.

### Fixed

- Updated package-lock.json to include the version number.

### Added

## [2.7.2] - 2018-05-11

https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui/pull/85
